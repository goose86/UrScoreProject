UrScore
Interactive golf scorecard application

UrScore was built using Swift 4 and Xcode 9.2 (beta)

-The app is fully functional and can either run on the simulator or be side loaded. Everything is working coreectly besides a few small errors listed below. I am currently working to get submitted to Apple for the iOS app store.

-Currently, the share button is not able to share to social networks and I am working on the updatet to fix.
-I am working on PickerViews for both the par and score counters
-The previous button should not be able to go back more than one hoe, to prevent changing scores, and I am working on an update to fix that issue.
