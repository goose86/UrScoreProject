"UrScore", a golf scorecard application that will be available on the iOS app store. 
Though there are many scorecard apps available on the market, UrScore will be a streamlined 
app where the user does NOT have to remember usernames and passwords, instead, ready to use 
once the app is opened. Using Xcode and Swift 4, the app will feature an easy to use design, 
pop-up notifications based on the score you get for each hole, and the ability to email and share 
your score.
Having taken the Udemy course and reading through Appleâ€™s developer documentation, I could learn 
and implement the basic iOS functions. I learned to work with UIViewControllers, UIAlertControllers,
button controls, label controls, and navigation through the Xcode UI. This foundation has enabled me 
to start working on additional, more advanced features, for my app including a weather widget, where I 
use the Alamofire Cocoapod and a weather API to tell the user what the current weather is and what it 
will be in the next few hours. I am still in the process of building these additional features but 
knowing that I have the basic abilities to use the tools required for iOS development has helped greatly 
with my confidence.
